		 <body>
		 <p>
I had spent years creating advertising design
and copy for many print publications, 
but coveted editorial space. Thus I began
freelancing. Currently I do public relations
writing for the Department of Anthropology.
My B.A. degree is in English, from the
University of South Carolina.
